A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array in Pandas. It can be thought of as a single column of data with labels or indices for each element. You can create a Series from various data sources, such as lists, NumPy arrays, or dictionaries
Here's a basic example of creating a Series in Pandas:

data=[1,2,3,4,5]
s= pd.Series(data)
print(s)

import pandas as pd

# Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 35, 28],
        'City': ['New York', 'San Francisco', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

print(df.iloc[2])   # Access the third row by position
print(df.loc[1])    # Access the second row by label
